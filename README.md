# Shiny Dashboard: Navigating Pandemic Realities

### Author: Jiaqin Wu

#### Data Source:
[U.S. Department of Health & Human Services](https://healthdata.gov/Hospital/COVID-19-Reported-Patient-Impact-and-Hospital-Capa/g62h-syeh)

#### Methodology:
We initiated the process by downloading the raw dataset, and meticulously curating it to include only the most pertinent variables aligning with our research objectives. The original dataset presented a time-series with daily counts, prompting us to transform it into a more manageable month-level format. This transformation allowed us to consolidate the data, providing a comprehensive overview at the monthly level rather than the intricacies of daily figures.

The resulting four distinct dataframes encapsulate key aspects: total case numbers, state-wise case numbers, inpatient bed statistics, and the distribution of death cases by case specifics. Leveraging these tailored dataframes, we seamlessly constructed an interactive dashboard using the R Shiny app, enabling users to navigate and glean insights from the data effortlessly.
